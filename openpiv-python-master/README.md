Warning
=======
The OpenPIV python version is currently in alpha state. This means that
it is buggy, untested and the API may change. However testing and contributing
is very welcome, especially if you can contribute with new algorithms and features.

Development is currently done on a Linux/Mac OSX environment, but as soon as possible 
Windows will be tested. If you have access to one of these platforms
please test the code.
