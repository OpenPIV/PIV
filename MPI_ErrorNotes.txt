Before, tried just using multiprocessing library for parallel operation on a single node. did pretty well for smaller size vide, but blew up and overloaded memory for larger videos. 

So I decided to give mpi a try

Some error codes I see

running mpiexec immediately after my modules from bashrc load I see this in my output, followed by a segment fault
librdmacm: Fatal: no RDMA devices found

ok, i think that the rdma issues may have been from trying to run mpirun from rclogin, trying to run an mpi from sbatch gives different set of erros 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "PIV_MPI_cluster.py", line 55, in <module>
    tif_files = [f for f in os.listdir(vidpath) if f.endswith('.tif')]
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/Data/TandemFanning/5_GoodRuns_140VAmp_105mmLens_Wake15khz/PhaseEffects0_-0.62832_pi_140V_100Hz_23-Apr-2015_1_11/'
        tif_files = [f for f in os.listdir(vidpath) if f.endswith('.tif')]

potentially I need to use an absolute path for MPI?
